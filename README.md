**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview
Project Overview
In this project, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the California Housing dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. EDA is a crucial step in data analysis as it helps us understand the underlying patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data. By performing EDA, we aim to gain insights into the data that can guide further analysis and modeling.
